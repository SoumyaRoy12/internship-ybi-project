ðŸ“¦ Recommender Systems for E-commerce Platforms
This project implements a Recommender System for e-commerce platforms using Python and Machine Learning techniques. The system provides personalized product suggestions to users based on their browsing history, purchase behavior, and preferences.

ðŸš€ Features
Collaborative Filtering (User-Based & Item-Based)

Content-Based Filtering

Hybrid Recommendation Model

Data Preprocessing and Cleaning

Product Similarity Score Calculation

User-Item Interaction Matrix

Visualization of recommendations

Jupyter Notebook/Colab-compatible implementation

ðŸ§  Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Surprise (for collaborative filtering)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Streamlit (optional, for web UI)

ðŸ“Š Dataset
This project uses a sample dataset from a fictional e-commerce platform, or publicly available datasets such as:

RetailRocket

Amazon Product Data

You can replace the dataset with your own platform's data for real-world integration.

ðŸ’¡ How It Works
Load and preprocess the dataset.

Train models using collaborative/content-based filtering.

Evaluate model performance (e.g., RMSE, Precision@K).

Generate top-N recommendations for each user.

Optionally deploy the model with a web interface.

âœ… Future Enhancements
Real-time recommendation with user session tracking

Deep learning-based recommender (using TensorFlow or PyTorch)

User authentication and dashboards
